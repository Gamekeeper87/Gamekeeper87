- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, My name is Jeff!

      I am a graduate from Waynesburg University with a Bachelor's Degree in Computer Science. I worked for SAP Ariba as a Tier 2 Technical Support Engineer in their Upstream services for 3 1/2 years as well as worked as a Student Support Specialist for the 3 1/2 years I was a college student. Most recently I have been a VIP Technical Support Analyst for Duquesne University going on 2 years now. As for personality, I am an outgoing individual with a bright outlook who loves technology, organization, good documentation, and efficiency. Fun Fact: for my college senior project I used Unreal Engine 4 to make a video game by myself. I have experience with technical troubleshooting and related processes, Git/Github, javascript, nodeJS, Express, React, HTML5, CSS, java, C++, SQL, & assembly programming languages (though willing to learn more), computer hardware installation, upkeep and architecture, and software installation, development, and theory, including knowledge of Operating Systems, Artificial Intelligence, Data Structures, Database Management, Systems Analysis, Algorithm Analysis, and Security, and Unreal Engine.

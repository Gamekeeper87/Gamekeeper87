- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, My name is Jeff!

      Technology and science has always fascinated me, so I always knew I'd want to work with computers somehow. After high school 
      I went on to get a bachelor's in Computer Science and start my career journey. Having prior experience with helpdesk work,
      I worked with SAP Ariba for a few years to get a feel for real high-level and corporate practices in my industry. 
      Now I'm moving forward in my career to my dream: learning more about coding and building on those skills so that
      I can be the best!
